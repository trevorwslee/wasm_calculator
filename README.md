## Development Environment

Here I will assume program development tools, like
* Of cause, the [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) programming language itself.
* The popular [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) program development editor / IDE, with the extensions:
  - [rust-analyzer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rust-lang.rust-analyzer)
* Preferably the popular source control tool [GIT](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
